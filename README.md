Student Career+ App - Flutter Project 

## About Application

This mobile app is developed for the purpose of improving student interaction with their respective staff.
The application's main moto is to provide cloud based services for instant information transfer.
This application uses Flutter UI Toolkit as front end and Firebase cloud service for back end cloud based services.

## About Us

Student Career+ App is completely developed by a Self taught process. By undertaking several courses (Special mention to Flutter Development Bootcamp - By Dr.Angela Yu) and referring to different documentations, we developed this complete app just within a month. By undertaking this project on our own, we learned several technologies and techniques to work on Cloud database, UI Building, efficient coding with OOP concepts and also how to collaborate as a team.

## Getting Started

We do not encourage any malpractice / misuse of the resources attached. This is completely for educational purposes only.
In order to run this app, here is a step by step explanation:

Make sure you have Android Studio, VS Code or any other platform that could emulate Android devices. I prefer Android Studio to be the best one for emulating Flutter applications.

## Running the Application

Step 1: Download and Install Android Studio on your Laptop or PC.
Step 2: Download and install Latest SDK's of Flutter and Dart. 
        Flutter : https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
        Dart : https://dart.dev/get-dart
Step 3: Open Android Studio and set up your virtual devices (OR) Connect your Android Device(USB Debugging enabled) onto your Laptop/PC
        Preferred Virtual device : PIXEL 4XL API 30 
        Refer this link on how to set up virtual devices : https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds
Step 4: Go to File -> New -> Project from version control.
Step 5: Under Version control dropdown- Select "Git".
Step 6: Under URL Tab paste the following : https://github.com/san-gitlogin/student_career_app
Step 7: Choose the directory where you want the Project files to get stored.
Step 8: Click on "Clone" and wait for Android Studio to fetch the project files (This may take a while based on your internet speed).
Step 9: Once the project files are loaded, Search for "pubspec.yaml" file in the project folder and open it.
Step 10: On the top right, Android studio might show a pop up bar with options named "pub get" "pub upgrade". Click on either of these and wait for Android studio to fetch necessary packages to run the application. Refer this documentation for more knowledge -> https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages
Step 11: Once everything is done, Choose your Android device on the top dropdown button and click on Run (A green play button on the top right) or press Shift+F10.

Wait for Android studio to run Gradle Task and check for any version incompatibilities. Once everything is alright, the app will be installed and run on your device.
